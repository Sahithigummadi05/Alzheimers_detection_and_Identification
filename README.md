This project aims to detect and classify Alzheimer’s Disease using structural MRI scans . By utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model learns to identify patterns in brain atrophy specifically in gray matter to distinguish between healthy brains and those showing signs of cognitive impairment.
